Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science for developing, testing and maintaining software. Software engineering has helped with reliability, efficiency and security.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Cloud computing. This is the delivery of computer services eg servers and software over the internet.
2. Artificial Intelligence. This is the simulation of human intelligence by computers
3. Quantum computing. This is a branch of maths and physics that uses quantum mechanics to solve complex problems faster than classic computers


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements. This is gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design. Creating high level designsod the software
3. Implementation. This is the actual writing of code
4. Testing. This is testing developed software to ensure it meets user needs and functional requirements.
5. Deployment. This is releasing the software to the market
6. Maintenance. This is ongoing software maintenance and enhancements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1.The waterfall methodology is a linear development cycle where there's no advancement to the next stage till the current is completed.This menthodolgy is suitable for projects with high level documentation and minimal expexted changes.
2.The agile methodology priorotizes collaboration and user feedback. It breaks tasks into smaller tasks that can be completed quickly. This is suitable for projects that have continous delivery.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.A software developer writes code and implements software solutions
2.A quality assurance engineer tests code to ensure product quality.
3.A project manager oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1.Intergrated development environments is a software suite that provides tools for writing code, debugging and testing code eg Eclipse
2.Version Control systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and colaboration of  projects between teammates.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements. Requirements may change during development leading to delays. This can be mitigated by having an open and concise channel for communication.
2. Tight deadlines. A project may have limited timeto be delivered. This can be mitigated by formulating a plan and chosing an effective methodology relevant to your project needs.
3. Technical debt. This can be accrued by maintenance costs or purchases of services. Yhis can be mitigated by allocating enough budget by considering anticipating financial needs.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Software quality assurance is critical to ensure it meets user requirements and functional needs.
1. Unit software is testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Intergration testing is testing interactions between differens=t components or subsystems
3. System testing is testing the entrie software as a whole.
4. Acceptance testing is testing software against user requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. This is important to help improve interactions between humans and AI.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
1. Tell me about cars.
2.  Tell me about the Mazda CX-70 and its fuel consumption.
